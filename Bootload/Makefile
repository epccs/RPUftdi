# sketch size: 30720 Diecimila (2k byt,bootsz 1k wrd), 32256 Uno (512 byt,bootsz 256 wrd), 32768 (nil bootsz)
# AVR instructions are essentially words, e.g. multiples of 16bits (except reading data from program memory, LPM)

# 12MHz Crystal Osc, slowly rising power, 16K CK startup time, 14CK +65ms reset delay.
# BOOTRST programmed so boot reset vector is enabled (in case a bootloader is added)
# EESAVE programmed to preserve EEPROM thru chip erase 
# 2v7 B.O.D. Enabled       note extended fuse value 0x05 is same as 0xFD since bits 3 thru 7 are hardware locked
